# About census map
![Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-ES5YPzoDg)

This is a little project about *web mapping* using **python** and **folium** that i was inspired to do it after i
saw a map from the world bank website.

so i have created something around that idea. 

### Overview of the project 
> - Layer control
> - Icon color reader
> - Data sorting
> - Data mapping

**Icon color reader**

*The following colors represent the range of a given country  population*
    
    blue <= 100
    purple <= 1000
    orange <= 10000
    darkgreen <= 100000
    beige <= 1000000
    black <= 10000000
    darkblue <= 100000000
    red <= the rest
